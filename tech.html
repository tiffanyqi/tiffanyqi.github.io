                <div class='body-description'>Hi! I'm a fullstack engineer with a track record of getting things done. Currently focusing on providing delightful user experiences at <a href="https://www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>. Incessant data collector and organizational wizard. Was top on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2017-01-28">Hacker News</a> once.</div>
            </div>

            <div class='section-container'>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'll say it straight, my path to engineering was not a conventional one. I began halfway through college at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> in 2014 simply curious about computer science. The intro class was really hard, but somehow I persevered, and became close with my computer science peers who understood the struggle. From there we created <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science Mentors</a>, a team of 100+ amazing volunteers furthering supporting the Computer Science department through tutoring and mentorship when the class enrollment billowed to over 2,000. The people here meant a lot to me and that was only the start of what was to come.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until 2017 when I joined <a href="https://www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> as a support engineer that I realized all of my life I just wanted to build and create things with my own two hands. Ever since I set foot at Mixpanel, all I was doing was developing side projects in my spare time filling some sort of gap in our team, and so I was fortunate to have been able to path to engineering in 2018.</p>
                <p>If you give something to build, I'll go and do it to the end. I enjoy filling the possible gaps in teams, and often take the role of impromptu lead simply through my extensive knowledge in what everyone is currently working on in the project and communicating obstacles and progress clearly. And while not flattering, I'm good at the glue work necessary to take the project to completion.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I'm not your standard developer who has been tinkering away on their PC creating games ever since they were 12. However, I bet my unconventional background, drive for completion, and role flexibility might surprise you just a bit.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Boards.</strong> Complete reshift of focus from a report centric to a dashboard centric Mixpanel. Built a large majority of the front-end experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Users.</strong> Tech lead for the users page (formerly known as Explore) redesign. Architected and built around half of the new front-end experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Content discovery.</strong> Improvements to search and how users discover content. Built the front-end experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Festive mode.</strong> Pretty holiday theme. Took a random idea from nothing to completion in a single month: falling snow in the navigation and using a custom winter spinner. Very well received by customers, one of the highest engaged posts on social media.</li>
                            <li><strong>Impact report.</strong> Report that shows you user activity and conversion in relation to specific event. One of the main engineers on the project, focused on the front-end.</li>
