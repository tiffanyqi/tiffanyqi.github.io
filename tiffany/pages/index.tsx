          Hi! I'm a fullstack engineer with a track record of getting things

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'll say it straight, my path to engineering was not a conventional
          one. I began halfway through college at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> in 2014 simply
          curious about computer science. The intro class was really hard, but
          somehow I persevered, and became close with my computer science peers
          who understood the struggle. From there we created{" "}
          <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science Mentors</a>
          , a team of 100+ amazing volunteers furthering supporting the Computer
          Science department through tutoring and mentorship when the class
          enrollment billowed to over 2,000. The people here meant a lot to me
          and that was only the start of what was to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until 2017 when I joined{" "}
          <a href="https://www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> as a support engineer
          that I realized all of my life I just wanted to build and create
          things with my own two hands. Ever since I set foot at Mixpanel, all I
          was doing was developing side projects in my spare time filling some
          sort of gap in our team, and so I was fortunate to have been able to
          path to engineering in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you give something to build, I'll go and do it to the end. I enjoy
          filling the possible gaps in teams, and often take the role of
          impromptu lead simply through my extensive knowledge in what everyone
          is currently working on in the project and communicating obstacles and
          progress clearly. And while not flattering, I'm good at the glue work
          necessary to take the project to completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I'm not your standard developer who has been tinkering
          away on their PC creating games ever since they were 12. However, I
          bet my unconventional background, drive for completion, and role
          flexibility might surprise you just a bit.

            Customer focused full stack software engineer using
            Typescript/Javascript (Panel) and Python (Django). I specialize in
            collaborating with design to build our vision and communicating
            exactly where we are in a project and taking a project to its
            completion. Some of my projects include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Boards.</strong> Complete reshift of focus from a report
                centric to a dashboard centric Mixpanel. Built a large majority
                of the front-end experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Users.</strong> Tech lead for the users page (formerly
                known as Explore) redesign. Architected and built around half of
                the new front-end experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content discovery.</strong> Improvements to search and
                how users discover content. Built the front-end experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Festive mode.</strong> Pretty holiday theme. Took a
                random idea from nothing to completion in a single month:
                falling snow in the navigation and using a custom winter
                spinner. Very well received by customers, one of the highest
                engaged posts on social media.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Impact report.</strong> Report that shows you user
                activity and conversion in relation to specific event. One of
                the main engineers on the project, focused on the front-end.
